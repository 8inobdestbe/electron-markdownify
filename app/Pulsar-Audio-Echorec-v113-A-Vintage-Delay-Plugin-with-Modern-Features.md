The Binson Echorec was used by many famous artists and bands, such as Pink Floyd, The Shadows, Led Zeppelin, and The Beatles. It had a unique sound that was warm, organic, and full of character. It could produce everything from subtle slapback echoes to lush modulated delays to psychedelic feedback loops.
 
Pulsar Audio â Echorec v1.1.3 captures the essence of the original device, but also adds some modern enhancements, such as:
 
- A stereo mode that allows you to process each channel separately or link them together.
- A sync mode that lets you sync the delay time to your DAW tempo or MIDI clock.
- A ducking mode that reduces the delay level when the input signal is present, to avoid cluttering the mix.
- A tone control that lets you adjust the brightness of the delay signal.
- A drift control that simulates the variations and imperfections of the analog circuitry.
- A mix lock feature that keeps the wet/dry balance constant when changing presets.
- A resizable GUI that adapts to your screen size and resolution.

Pulsar Audio â Echorec v1.1.3 is compatible with Windows and Mac OS X, and supports VST, VST3, and AAX formats. It is available for purchase from the Pulsar Audio website for 69â¬ (regular price 99â¬). You can also download a free trial version to test it out before buying.
 
If you are a fan of vintage delay effects, or if you want to add some analog warmth and vibe to your digital productions, you should definitely give Pulsar Audio â Echorec v1.1.3 a try. It is one of the best emulations of the Binson Echorec on the market, and it will surely inspire you to create some amazing sounds.
  
One of the most distinctive features of the Binson Echorec was its magnetic drum, which consisted of a rotating metal cylinder with four playback heads. The drum speed and the distance between the heads determined the delay time and the feedback pattern. The plugin allows you to adjust these parameters with the speed and program knobs, as well as switch between 12 different head combinations with the selector switch.
 
The plugin also reproduces the modulation and saturation effects that were inherent to the original device. The modulation was caused by the mechanical instability of the drum, which created subtle pitch variations and chorusing effects. The saturation was caused by the magnetic tape that coated the drum, which added some harmonic distortion and compression to the signal. The plugin lets you control these effects with the modulation and input knobs, as well as turn them on or off with the switches.
 
Another feature that sets Pulsar Audio â Echorec v1.1.3 apart from other delay plugins is its advanced stereo processing. The plugin can operate in three different stereo modes: mono, ping-pong, and dual. In mono mode, the plugin processes both channels with the same settings and outputs a mono signal. In ping-pong mode, the plugin alternates the delay signal between the left and right channels, creating a stereo ping-pong effect. In dual mode, the plugin processes each channel independently, allowing you to create different delay effects for each channel.
