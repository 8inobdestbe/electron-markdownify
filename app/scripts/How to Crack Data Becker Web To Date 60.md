- **No updates or support:** Cracked software cannot receive updates or patches from the official source. This means that you will miss out on new features, bug fixes, and security improvements. You will also not be able to contact the customer service or get technical assistance if you encounter any problems.
- **Incompatibility and instability:** Cracked software might not work properly with your system or your web host. It might cause errors, crashes, or performance issues. It might also conflict with other software or plugins that you use on your website.
